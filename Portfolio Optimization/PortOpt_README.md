# Portfolio Optimization
  - At its core, MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory) is all about capitalizing on returns while maintaining your best position
    and the theory plays a crucial role in many, if not every, financial related institutions.
  - I really want to spearhead this as it is a good change of air + important topic/section that we need to cover

# Plans + Goals
  - A few modern portfolio management theories covered in [this academic paper based off of Harry Markowitz's "Portfolio Selection"] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221713008898)
      + [Risk-parity portfolio] (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-parity.asp)
      + Multi-period portfolio optimization
      + CVaR + VaR: Monte Carlo Method
      + [Asset allocation using Convex Optimization] (https://medium.com/where-quant-meets-data-science/asset-allocation-using-convex-portfolio-optimization-f47398d4d613)
      + [Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp)
  - Combine models and knowledge developed here to expand QTC
      + PMT is looking to expand on a "Portfolio Manangement" sector
